Hi, I’m Aren

I’m a love using data to paint interesting pictures! I would love to work on new projects that push my learning forward. 

I currently have the following in my repo:

### **NFL Playing Surfaces** ###
A data analytics [project](https://github.com/SmmnsMo/NFL-Playing-Surface-Analytics) (in progress) that was focused on the safety and playability of NFL surfaces. 

### **Media Analysis**
Originally intended to create a database of Media articles to compare and contrast how each outlet reports on current events however due to unforseen circumstances, I scrapped the project.
However I completed a [webscraper](https://github.com/SmmnsMo/MediaAnalysis/blob/main/FoxNewsScraper.py) that was functional.
  
### **Amazon Reviews Natural Language Classifier**
A [Natural Language Classifier](https://github.com/SmmnsMo/Amazon-Review-Helpfulness) used to analyze what makes an Amazon Review useful (or not).  
This yielded an f1-score of .68 using a Multinomial Naive Bayes model.
  
### **NBA Rookie Salary Regression Analysis**
A [regression analysis](https://github.com/SmmnsMo/ML-in-Basketball) based on NBA rookie salaries (how well does each players' college performances translate to their rookie salaries).  
Yielded an r-squared score of .168.
